# 🔮 IHATEYOU: Future Roadmap & Vision

## 1. 🧬 Digital Intimacy & "Soul Sync"
Taking the concept of "connection" beyond just text.

*   **🫀 Heartbeat Haptics**: When you and your partner are both in the chat, the phone vibrates gently in a "heartbeat" rhythm. Features a visual pulsing "core" in the center of the screen that syncs up.
*   **🌌 The Astral Plane (Shared Canvas)**: A background layer behind your chat where you can doodle, stick digital stickers, or leave floating notes that fade away after 24 hours. A shared "mind space."
*   **🎵 Music Resonance**: Integration with Spotify/Apple Music to show *exactly* what part of a song you are listening to, allowing you to "listen along" in real-time with perfect sync.

## 2. 🧠 Expanded "Echo" AI
Making the AI feel less like a bot and more like a digital spirit guide.

*   **🌙 Dreamweaver**: A dedicated "Dream Journal" input. Echo analyzes your dreams for recurring themes and emotional undertones, generating a specific "Dreamscape" image using AI generation.
*   **⚡ De-escalation Protocol**: If Echo detects heated sentiment or "combat" keywords in a chat, it gently changes the UI color to calming cool tones and suggests a "Time Out" or a breathing exercise.
*   **🎭 Dynamic Avatars**: Your profile picture isn't static. It subtly morphs expressions (smiling, frowning, neutral) based on the sentiment of your last 5 messages.

## 3. 💎 "The Void" Gamification
Turning emotional expression into a rewarding loop.

*   **🌈 Aura System**: Users get a colored "Aura" glow around their messages/avatar based on their dominant emotion of the week. (e.g., Golden = Grateful, Blue = Melancholy, Red = Intense).
*   **📦 Void Drops**: Rare, collectible themes or "stickers" that only unlock under mysterious conditions (e.g., sending a message at exactly 3:33 AM, or chatting for 2 hours straight).
*   **🔑 The ARG Layer**: Hidden messages in the "glitch" text of the UI. Decrypting them unlocks "Developer Mode" or secret "Forbidden" color themes.

## 4. 🎛️ Hyper-Aesthetics
Pushing the "Premium/Edgy" vibe to the limit.

*   **🔊 Sonic Ambience**: Each theme gets a background drone/track. "Retro" gets tape hiss and synth pads; "Dark" gets rain and distant thunder.
*   **📺 Glitch Mode**: An optional setting where the UI reacts to loud noises (via microphone) or fast typing by visually "glitching" (chromatic aberration, pixel shifts).
*   **🕶️ Privacy "Burn"**: A "True Ghost" mode where messages physically burn away (particle effect) immediately after being read.

## 5. 📱 Technical Unlocks
*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Marketing it as "Void Sealed" – mathematically impossible for anyone but the two souls to read.
*   **Offline "Time Capsules"**: Write messages while offline. They are packaged as "Time Capsules" and delivered with a special unlocking animation when you reconnect.
